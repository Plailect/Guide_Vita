### Required Reading

If you have already hacked your PS Vita (TV) before on 3.60, follow [Updating to 3.65 (HENkaku)](updating-to-3.65-(henkaku)) before continuing.
{: .notice--warning}

The hencore exploit is only compatible with the firmware version 3.65, 3.67, and 3.68. As a result, lower firmware versions must update using a custom update server in order to use the exploit.

To do this, we configure your network's DNS settings to use a custom update server which will always tell your device that 3.65 is the latest update available. This has the effect of blocking any firmware versions above 3.65 from being installed when the device attempts to perform an update.

While the h-encore exploit itself is compatible with firmware versions 3.67 and 3.68, we will be updating to firmware version 3.65 as it is the latest version which still supports the Ensō boot-time exploit.

### What you need

* An internet connection on your PS Vita (TV)

### Instructions

#### Section I - DNS Configuration

Note that these DNS servers will need to be set on each network you connect your device to for it to block updates!
