### 必读事项

Ensō 是 PS Vita（TV）使用自制固件的一套解决方案，依靠本方案，可在你的主机开机时自动配置HENkaku环境，可以在你的设备上方便地使用自制软件。

它比 HENkaku 更方便，因为它不需要在每次设备重启后手动触发漏洞进入破解模式。

In this guide, we'll be using VitaDeploy to install both HENkaku Ensō and firmware version 3.65. If you want to install it manually, follow [Installing Ensō (3.60)](installing-enso-(3.60)) or [Installing Ensō (3.65)](installing-enso-(3.65)).

This mod will make PERMANENT modifications to your device. If anything goes wrong, there is no recovery. While the tool has worked successfully for many users, you take sole responsibility in what happens to your device.
