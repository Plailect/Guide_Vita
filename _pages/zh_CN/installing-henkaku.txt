### 必读事项

HENkaku is an exploit chain for the PS Vita (TV) which will allow for the installation of homebrew applications to the LiveArea Screen. It is only compatible with the firmware version 3.60.

Note that the HENkaku exploit chain is not "persistent" (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). Fortunately, this is only a temporary restriction until HENkaku Ensō is installed on the next page.

In addition to running the HENkaku exploit, we will also enable access to "unsafe" homebrew which gives extended permissions to homebrew applications. This idea could be considered analagous to the "administrator" mode on a computer.

如果你的设备是 PS Vita 1000，你需要用到一张 Sony 原厂内存卡（任意容量）来继续此教程。 此限制不适用于 PS Vita 2000 或 PS TV，因为这些机型都有内置储存卡。
