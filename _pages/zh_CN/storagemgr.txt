### Required Reading

StorageMgr is a multi-purpose kernel plugin for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for the use of alternative storage devices such as a USB drive, an SD2Vita, or a psvd.

The SD2Vita is a microSD to game card adapter which is inserted into the game-card slot in your device, while the psvd is a microSD adapter which replaces the 3g modem on 3g PS Vita models.

By using the StorageMgr kernel plugin, the USB drive or microSD card you use will be mounted to `ux0:` just like a Sony memory card. This is very useful because microSD cards are significantly cheaper than Sony memory cards (especially at higher capacities).

This will use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the files, so your Vita and PC must be connected to the same network.

你必须安装了 VitaShell 才能使用此软件。

### 准备工作

* A formatted storage device compatible with your system
  + To format your device, see [Storage Format (Windows)](storage-format-(windows)), [Storage Format (Linux)](storage-format-(linux)), or [Storage Format (Mac)](storage-format-(mac))
* 一个 FTP 连接软件，比如 [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) 或 [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
  + 或者，你也可以使用 VitaShell 的 USB 传输功能
* The latest release of [StorageMgr](https://github.com/CelesteBlue-dev/PSVita-StorageMgr/releases)
  + `storage_config.txt` should be edited to fit your situation as instructed in the [README](https://github.com/CelesteBlue-dev/PSVita-StorageMgr/blob/master/README.md#how-to-configure-storagemgr-)
  + `MCD=uma0` should be kept as-is if you plan to keep a Sony memory card in your device, and removed otherwise
  + `INT=imc0` should be kept as-is for PS Vita 2000 and PS TV users, and removed for PS Vita 1000 users
  + `GCD=ux0` should be kept as-is for SD2Vita users, and edited to `UMA=ux0` for USB drive and psvd users
  + `UMA=grw0` should be removed unless you have multiple storage devices (in which case the device which is not assigned to `ux0:` should be assigned to `grw0:`)

### 操作步骤

#### Section I - Installing Plugins

1. Transfer `storagemgr.skprx` to the `ur0:tai/` folder
1. Transfer `storage_config.txt` to  the `ur0:tai/` folder
1. For any paths in `ur0:tai/config.txt` which contain `ux0:tai/`, replace `ux0:tai/` with `ur0:tai/` 
  + If you did not have a `ux0:tai/` folder, skip this step
1. Add the following line to `ur0:tai/config.txt` under the `*KERNEL` line:
  + `ur0:tai/storagemgr.skprx`

1. Insert your new storage device into your computer
1. Copy the contents of your `ux0:` folder to your new storage device
  + This may take some time if you have a large amount of data on your Sony memory card

{% capture notice-1 %}
If you want to reclaim the space on your memory card (to use for storing PSP games for instance), you can delete the contents of `uma0:` (the new memory card mount point) and / or `imc0:` (if you have a PS Vita 2000 or PS TV).

If you decide to do this and are using h-encore on firmware versions 3.67 or 3.68, you must *not* delete these folders:

  + `uma0:app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:appmeta/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:data/bootstrap.self`
  + `uma0:license/app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:user/00/savedata/PCSG90096`

This is because you must keep h-encore installed to the memory card so you can enable HENkaku (and therefore StorageMgr) after a reboot.

Your new storage device is now configured and ready for use at the mount point specified in your `storage_config.txt`.
