### 必读事项

This is an add-on section for formatting a storage device for use with the StorageMgr kernel plugin.

Additionally, there is an optional section for checking your storage device for errors using F3X. Depending on the size of your storage device and the speed of your computer, the checking process can take up to several hours!

This page is for Mac users only. If you are not on Mac, check out the [Storage Format (Windows)](storage-format-(windows)) or [Storage Format (Linux)](storage-format-(linux)) pages.
