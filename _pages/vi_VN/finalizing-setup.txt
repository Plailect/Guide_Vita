### Required Reading

We will now setup applications and plugins such as the following:

+  **Vita Homebrew Browser** *(downloads and installs other homebrew applications)*
+  **NoNpDrm** *(allows for encrypted games and applications to be used)*
+  **reF00D** *(allows for transparently decrypting games and applications of any firmware version)*
+  **DownloadEnabler** *(allows any file type to be downloaded with the browser)*
+  **shellbat** *(displays exact battery percentage in the status bar)*
+  **pngshot** *(improves the built-in screenshot utility)*

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) file on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card.

We will also block updates using a DNS server. The server tricks your device into detecting 3.60 as the latest firmware version, meaning it won't update past that. This is useful because 3.60 is the earliest firmware that HENkaku works on. These settings must be applied to every network that you join.

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
  + Alternatively, you can also use the USB transfer feature of VitaShell

  + The `ur0:` partition corresponds to the internal system memory which is always present on all devices (on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV, this is *not* the same as the built-in memory card!)
1. Transfer `VitaHBBrowser.vpk` to the `data` folder
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ux0:`
