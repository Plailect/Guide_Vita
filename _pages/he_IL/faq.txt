<a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest system version, is my device hackable?*    
**A:** Not at this time.

<a name="faq_downgrade" />**Q:** *Can I downgrade my Vita?*    
**A:** Yes, but only if the console is already on a hackable firmware. Modoru can downgrade any system hacked with HENkaku or H-Encore to any firmware equal or greater than the firmware the console came with out of the box.

<a name="faq_update" />**Q:** *Is it safe to update a Vita with CFW?*    
**A:** No! You must always ensure that you have blocked updates as specified at the end of [Finalizing Setup](finalizing-setup).

<a name="faq_updates" />**Q:** *Now that Sony has ended production of the Vita, does that mean no more updates will be released?*    
**A:** This is not necessarily the case. The firmware version 3.68 was released six months after the previous update (at which point it was assumed no new updates would be released).

<a name="faq_risky" />**Q:** *How risky is hacking my console?*    
**A:** Bricks are *basically* impossible unless you ignore instructions.

<a name="faq_homebrew" />**Q:** *Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this?*    
**A:** Yes! This enables any custom user-made homebrew to be played on your device.

<a name="faq_support" />**Q:** *Where should I go for support?*    
**A:** For support, ask for help at [Vita Hacking on Discord](https://discord.gg/JXEKeg6).

<a name="faq_nopc" />**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer?*    
**A:** No! You must have a PC to complete this guide.
