### Required Reading

We will now setup applications and plugins such as the following:

+  **NoNpDrm** *(allows for encrypted games and applications to be used)*
+  **0syscall6** *(allows using games and applications that require higher firmware versions)*
+  **DownloadEnabler** *(allows any file type to be downloaded with the browser)*
+  **shellbat** *(displays exact battery percentage in the status bar)*
+  **pngshot** *(improves the built-in screenshot utility)*

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) file on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card.

We will also block updates using a DNS server. The server tricks your device into detecting 3.60 as the latest firmware version, meaning it won't update past that. This is useful because 3.60 is the earliest firmware that HENkaku works on. These settings must be applied to every network that you join.

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
  + Alternatively, you can also use the USB transfer feature of VitaShell
* [config.txt]({{ "/assets/files/config.txt" | absolute_url }}){:download="config.txt"}
* The latest release of [NoNpDrm](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [0syscall6](https://github.com/SKGleba/0syscall6/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [DownloadEnabler](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaTweaks/releases/tag/DownloadEnabler)
* The latest release of [shellbat](https://github.com/nowrep/vita-shellbat/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [pngshot](https://github.com/xyzz/pngshot/releases/latest)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Launch the VitaShell application
1. Press (Start) to open the VitaShell settings
1. Press (Cross) on "SELECT button" to change the mode to "FTP"
  + Alternatively, you can leave this setting on "USB" and transfer all files via a USB cable for the remainder of this guide
  + Note that the USB transfer mode will start you in the ux0 partition
  + Additionally, some files will be hidden in USB mode on Windows; you must enable "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" and disable "Hide protected operating system files" in the File Explorer options in order to see all files
1. Press (Circle) to close the VitaShell settings
1. Press (Select) to enable FTP access on your device
1. Open your FTP client on your computer
1. Enter the IP Address and Port displayed on your device
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ux0:`
  + The `ux0:` partition corresponds to the memory card of your device (on the PS Vita 1000, this partition will always be the external memory card; on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV, this partition will either be the external memory card if one is inserted, or the built-in memory card otherwise)
  + The `ur0:` partition corresponds to the internal system memory which is always present on all devices (on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV, this is *not* the same as the built-in memory card!)
1. Delete the `tai` folder if it exists
1. Navigate to `ur0:` -> `tai/`
1. Transfer `config.txt` to  the `tai` folder
  + Overwrite (replace) the existing `config.txt` file
1. Transfer `nonpdrm.skprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `0syscall6.skprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `download_enabler.suprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `shellbat.suprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Transfer `pngshot.suprx` to the `tai` folder
1. Press (Circle) on your device to close the FTP connection

#### Section II - Blocking Updates

1. Launch the Settings application
1. Navigate to `Network` -> `Wi-Fi Settings`
  + Connect to a Wi-Fi network if you have not already done so
1. Select your current connection
  + This is signified by a green dot next to the network
1. Select "Advanced Settings"
1. Set "DNS Settings" to "Manual"
  + You must apply the following DNS settings to each network you use
1. Set "Primary DNS" to `212.47.229.76`
1. Set "Secondary DNS" to `212.47.229.76`
1. Ensure "Proxy Server" is set to "Do Not Use"
1. Close the Settings application

#### Section III - PSN Access

1. Launch the Settings application
1. Navigate to `HENkaku Settings`
1. Check "Enable PSN spoofing"
1. Check "Enable Version Spoofing"
1. Navigate to "Spoofed Version"
1. Enter "3.73" into the box
  + Should a new firmware version be released in the future, you must change the spoofed version to match in order to access PSN
1. Close the Settings application

#### Section IV - Cleanup

1. Launch the Content Manager application
1. Select "Manage Content on Memory Card"
1. Select "PS Vita"
1. Delete the following applications if they exist (note that, depending on your install method, some or all of these applications may be missing):
  + "ensō"
  + "modoru 戻る"
  + "molecularShell"
1. Users on firmware version 3.60 should additionally delete the following application if it exists:
  + "h-encore"
