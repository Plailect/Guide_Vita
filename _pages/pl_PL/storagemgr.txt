### Required Reading

StorageMgr is a multi-purpose kernel plugin for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for the use of alternative storage devices such as a USB drive, an SD2Vita, or a psvd.

The SD2Vita is a microSD to game card adapter which is inserted into the game-card slot in your device, while the psvd is a microSD adapter which replaces the 3g modem on 3g PS Vita models.

Using the StorageMgr kernel plugin, the USB drive or microSD card you use will be mounted to `ux0:` just like a Sony memory card. This is very useful because microSD cards are significantly cheaper than Sony memory cards (especially at higher capacities).

This will use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the files so your Vita and PC must be connected to the same network.

You must have already installed VitaShell to use this.

  + Alternatively, you can also use the USB transfer feature of VitaShell

  + `MCD=uma0` should almost always be kept as-is
  + `INT=imc0` should be kept as-is for PS Vita 2000 and PS TV users, and removed for PS Vita 1000 users
  + `GCD=ux0` should be kept as-is for SD2Vita users, and edited to `UMA=ux0` for USB drive and psvd users
  + `UMA=grw0` should be removed unless you have multiple storage devices
