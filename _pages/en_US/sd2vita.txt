### Required Reading

Yamt is a multi-purpose kernel plugin for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for the use of alternative storage devices such as a USB drive, an SD2Vita, or a psvd.

The SD2Vita is a microSD to game card adapter which is inserted into the game-card slot in your device, while the psvd is a microSD adapter which replaces the 3g modem on 3g PS Vita models.

By using the YAMT kernel plugin, the USB drive or microSD card you use will be mounted to `ux0:` just like a Sony memory card. This is very useful because microSD cards are significantly cheaper than Sony memory cards (especially at higher capacities) and can have double, quadruple, or theoretically up to 16 times the capacity of the largest official memory card. If you have a Sony memory card, it can be used exclusively for PSP games in Adrenaline so they don't take up space on your SD2Vita, psvsd, or USB drive.

This will use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the files, so your Vita and PC must be connected to the same network.

You must have already installed VitaShell and Enso to use this.

{% capture notice-1 %}
If you want to reclaim the space on your memory card (to use for storing PSP games for instance), you can delete the contents of `uma0:` (the new memory card mount point) and / or `imc0:` (if you have a PS Vita 2000 or PS TV).

If you decide to do this and are using h-encore on firmware versions 3.67 or 3.68, you must *not* delete these folders:

  + `uma0:app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:appmeta/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:data/bootstrap.self`
  + `uma0:license/app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:user/00/savedata/PCSG90096`

This is because you must keep h-encore installed to the memory card so you can enable HENkaku (and therefore StorageMgr) after a reboot.

Your new storage device is now configured and ready for use at the mount point specified in your `storage_config.txt`.
