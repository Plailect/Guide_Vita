## What is Homebrew/HENkaku?

HENkaku is the first ever homebrew enabler for PS Vita and PSTV. [**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games){:target="_blank"} usually refers to software that is not authorized by Sony. This includes homebrew tools, applications, games, and emulators.

Running homebrew on your console is 100% free using nothing but the system's browser.

## What is HENkaku Ensō?

**HENkaku Ensō** launches HENkaku automatically on boot, without having to launch it through the browser.

CFW can be easily set up on any console in any region on the system version 3.60.

## What does this guide install?

This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Vita from stock firmware to HENkaku Ensō. HENkaku Ensō is not required to be installed, but is recommended.

## What can I do with Custom Firmware?

+ Use a microSD card for storage instead of Sony’s expensive proprietary memory cards
+ Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games
+ Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators.
+ Install homebrew titles to your system, and have them appear on your system menu
+ Dump your games to a format you can install, and play them without needing the cartridge

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Vita hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.**
+ This guide will work on all PS Vita devices in all regions on the version 3.60 and below.
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, saves, etc will be preserved).
+ You must have an official Sony memory card if you have a PS Vita 1000. Size does not matter.
