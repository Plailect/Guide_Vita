title: "Installing VitaShell to System"

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

This will install VitaShell to system by injecting it into another system app through a homebrew application called HBInjector.

This is recommended as formatting on HENkaku Ens≈ç 3.65 removes VitaShell. If you are stuck without VitaShell, you will not be able to install homebrew applications, and you will lose homebrew access.

By injecting VitaShell into a system app, we will always be able to access VitaShell, even after a format.

The system application can be restored using the HBInjector application. It is also restored when updating, so don't install this *before* updating to 3.65, as it won't make a difference.

The selected system app will remain unusable until it is restored.

The system app backups will be stored in `ux0:data/HBInjector`

After installing VitaShell to system, the database will be rebuilt and the app layout will be reset. This is necessary as VitaShell will not work on the system without doing this.
