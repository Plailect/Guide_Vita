### Required Reading

This will enable unsafe homebrew on your Vita, and install the VitaShell and Vita Homebrew Browser applications to your home menu.

VitaShell is a file manager and homebrew installer for the PS Vita. It is similar to MolecularShell, except with many more features added in. VitaShell is the recommended file manager for the PS Vita.

The Vita Homebrew Browser is a homebrew application which will allow you to install and update homebrew applications from the Vita itself, without a PC.

This will use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the files so your Vita and PC must be connected to the same network.
