### Required Reading

USBMC is an alternative to Sony's expensive proprietry memory cards. It allows you to use USB memory with a PSTV, or a microSD card with PSVD boards on 3G Vita 1000s.

The method will install the USBMC plugin to allow you to use the microSD adapter on your Vita. HENkaku is required for this.

This will use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the files so your Vita and PC must be connected to the same network.

### What You Need

- A HENkaku enabled PS Vita
- An FTP Client
	- For Windows, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) are recommended
