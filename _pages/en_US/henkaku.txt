### Required Reading

HENkaku is a homebrew enabler for the PS Vita which will allow you to install homebrew applications to the home menu.

We launch this using the Vita's built in browser, so your Vita will need to be able to access the internet.

Remember that if you have a PS Vita 1000, you must have a memory card. Size does not matter.

You must be on system version 3.60 to install HENkaku.

We will also enable unsafe homebrew and install the Vita Homebrew Browser, a homebrew application which will allow you to install other homebrew applications from the console itself, without a PC.
