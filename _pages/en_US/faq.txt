<a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest system version, is my device hackable?*    
**A:** No, you must be on 3.60 or below.

<a name="faq_newfw" />**Q:** *I have a Vita on 3.61+ version. Is there a HENkaku exploit coming soon?*

<a name="faq_downgrade" />**Q:** *Can I downgrade my Vita to 3.60 or below?*
