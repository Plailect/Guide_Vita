### Required Reading

SD2Vita is a microSD to gamecard adapter for the PS Vita. It allows you to use a microSD card as storage for your Vita instead of Sony's expensive proprietary memory cards.

The method will install the SD2Vita plugin to allow you to use the microSD adapter on your Vita. HENkaku is required for this.

This will use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to transfer the files so your Vita and PC must be connected to the same network.

### What You Need

- A HENkaku enabled PS Vita
- An FTP Client
	- For Windows, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) are recommended
- The latest release of [gamecard-microsd](https://github.com/xyzz/gamecard-microsd/releases/latest)
- The latest release of [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
- [zzBlank.img](/assets/files/zzBlank.img)
