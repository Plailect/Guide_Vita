### 必讀事項

Ensō 是一套適用於 PS Vita (TV) 的自製韌體方案。透過本方案，您的主機能於啟動時自動設置 HENkaku 環境，讓您能輕易地使用自製軟體。

因為 HENkaku 需於每次主機重新啟動時重新手動觸發漏洞，此方案相對方便許多。

In this guide, we'll be using VitaDeploy to install both HENkaku Ensō and firmware version 3.65. If you want to install it manually, follow [Installing Ensō (3.60)](installing-enso-(3.60)) or [Installing Ensō (3.65)](installing-enso-(3.65)).

This mod will make PERMANENT modifications to your device. If anything goes wrong, there is no recovery. While the tool has worked successfully for many users, you take sole responsibility in what happens to your device.
