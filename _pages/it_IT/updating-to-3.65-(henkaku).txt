### Required Reading

These steps are for preparing a 3.60 HENkaku (Ensō) device to update to 3.65. If you have a stock device and are trying to update to 3.65, follow [Updating to 3.65](updating-to-3.65).
{: .notice--warning}

Updating your 3.60 HENkaku (Ensō) device to the firmware version 3.65 will allow you to access the PS Store, use online features, and play newer games which require newer firmware versions, all while retaining access to the convenient boot-time Ensō homebrew exploit.

If you have a PS Vita 1000, you must also have an official Sony memory card (of any size) to follow this guide. An SD2Vita device will not work for this update process. This restriction does not apply to the PS Vita 2000 or PS TV as those devices have a built-in memory card.
